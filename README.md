# Race-War
Race War is a 2 player turn-based game based on stereotypes.

This is a game exclusively between me and my friends, so outside input is not needed.

This is intended to be for only me and my friends, but if you want to download it as well, even though it isn't very good, feel free.
However, viewer discretion is advised, as the content may cause offense to some. If you play our game and take offense,
do not complain, as we have issued this warning. This game does not discrimate (any person can play it),
and it does not abuse (any person that feels offended can simply stop playing).


Have a nice day.
